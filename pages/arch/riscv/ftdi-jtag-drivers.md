## Problem

Both the HiFive1 and the Arty boards use FTDI to access the JTAG interface.

By default, the standard FTDI drivers available on Windows and macOS assume the FTDI chip is used to connect UART ports via USB.

The FTDI chip can be reconfigured to access the JTAG interface via direct drivers, but this requires the presence of a small EEPROM to store the configuration, and neither board has this EEPROM physically installed.

On the HiFive1 board the problem is complicated by the fact that the second FTDI interface is used to forward the trace stream and must remain a virtual UART.

Except on GNU/Linux, where direct access to USB devices is native, for Windows and macOS there is no elegant solution to this problem, but only some work-arounds.

## Windows

Windows allows a port to be acceed via the user-space WinUSB driver only after explicitly reconfiguring a specific interface for direct drivers.

This requires installing a special driver, specifically configured for a given VID:PID.

One possible solution is [libusbk](https://sourceforge.net/projects/libusbk/), which also comes with a tool to generate these drivers. As with usual drivers, this generated driver can be installed and uninstalled, if no longer needed.

An older workaround used a tool called Zadig, but this tool had the major disadvantage that changes were permanent, and it was not possible to return the FTDI device to the default UART.

TODO: provide the driver binaries.

## macOS

When dealing with USB drivers, Apple is even stricter; if the USB device has any of the FTDI VID:PID pairs, macOS assumes it should be associated with a virtual UART device, and there is no simple way to reconfigure this.

To view the attached USB devices on macOS, use `system_profiler`. For example, the HiFive1 board is seen as Dual RS232-HS, PID:VID 6010:0403:

```console
$ system_profiler SPUSBDataType
...
    Dual RS232-HS:

      Product ID: 0x6010
      Vendor ID: 0x0403  (Future Technology Devices International Limited)
      Version: 7.00
      Speed: Up to 480 Mb/sec
      Manufacturer: FTDI
      Location ID: 0xfa130000 / 5
      Current Available (mA): 500
      Current Required (mA): 500
      Extra Operating Current (mA): 0
```

If you already use FTDI based USB/UART adapters, remember the Product ID, since you need to manually enable it in a later step.

By default, macOS identifies the board as a **Dual RS232-HS** device, and offers to configure it as a network interface. Since the HiFive1 board does not have an EEPROM to store an unique ID, the devices are named using a string containing the address in the HUB hierarchy, so the `a13` letters in the name are different when connecting the board to a different USB port.

```console
$ ls -l /dev/tty.usbserial*
crw-rw-rw-  1 root  wheel   19,  28 Jul 10 12:09 /dev/tty.usbserial-fa13A
crw-rw-rw-  1 root  wheel   19,  30 Jul 10 12:09 /dev/tty.usbserial-fa13B
```

Attempts to open the trace port (the second UART) are ok:

```console
$ screen /dev/tty.usbserial-fa13B 115200

Use `Ctrl-A Ctrl-K` to kill the session, or `Ctrl-A Ctrl-D` to detach and `screen -r` to reconnect.

Attempts to open the HiFive1 board with OpenOCD fail with:

```console
$ openocd -f board/sifive-freedom-e300-hifive1.cfg

Error: unable to open ftdi device with vid 0403, pid 6010, description 'Dual RS232-HS', serial '*' at bus location '*'
```

The workaround it to disable all _personalities_ of the AppleUSBFTDI kernel:

```console
$ sudo kextunload -verbose -bundle-id com.apple.driver.AppleUSBFTDI -personalities-only
```

This command will remove the UART associations for all FTDI based devices. All devices will be available for user space drivers, like `libusb`. 

In the HiFive1 case, the first interface should no longer be available as a tty device, but as JTAG, and OpenOCD should be able to connect to the JTAG interface:

```console
$ openocd -f board/sifive-freedom-e300-hifive1.cfg

```

This next command will redo the UART association only for the given personality, in this case the second interface of PID 0x6010 (`AppleUSBEFTDI-6010-1`).

```console
$ sudo kextutil -verbose -bundle-id com.apple.driver.AppleUSBFTDI -personality AppleUSBEFTDI-6010-1
$ ls -l /dev/tty.usbserial*
crw-rw-rw-  1 root  wheel   19,  30 Jul 10 12:09 /dev/tty.usbserial-fa13B
```

The second interface should be available again to `screen`, as before.

If you have other FTDI devices that you need to remain associated to UART, issue similar commands, for each one.

The AppleUSBFTDI module has many _personalities_; to bring them back, start `kextutil` in interractive mode, or reboot:

```console
$ sudo kextutil -verbose -bundle-id com.apple.driver.AppleUSBFTDI -interactive
Defaulting to kernel file '/System/Library/Kernels/kernel'

### Use case

I personaly have two USB/UART DB-9 adapters and the RISC-V HiFive1 and Arty boards.

To make them work, I use a file

```console
# Disable all FTDI devices
kextunload -verbose -bundle-id com.apple.driver.AppleUSBFTDI -personalities-only
# Enable the second interface on the HiFive1 board
kextutil -verbose -bundle-id com.apple.driver.AppleUSBFTDI -personality AppleUSBEFTDI-6010-1
# Enable the DIGITUS USB/UART DB-9 adapters
kextutil -verbose -bundle-id com.apple.driver.AppleUSBFTDI -personality AppleUSBEFTDI-6001
```

that I start with:

```console
$ sudo bash ${HOME}/opt/scripts/ftdi.sh
```

## GNU/Linux

GNU/Linux systems do not need suplimentary drivers to access the FTDI devices, but only some configuration tweaks.

```console
$ lsusb
...
Bus XXX Device XXX: ID 0403:6010 Future Technology Devices
International, Ltd FT2232C Dual USB-UART/FIFO IC
```
